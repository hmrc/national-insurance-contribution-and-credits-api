        NICC Interface Specification to retrieve Class 1 and Class 2 data.
      description: |-
        # Purpose
        This API provides the capability to retrieve Class 1 and Class 2 data for an account.<br>
        - This allows a search for Class 1 contributions and Class 2 credits for a given NINO (suffix optional) and range of tax years.
        - Request payload will contain the start tax year, end tax year, national insurance number and date of birth.<br>
        - This endpoint requires Mutual Authentication over TLS 1.2. <br><p>
